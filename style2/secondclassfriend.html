            <h3><i>I have been wondering for a while if there's something wrong with me or is something wrong with the people that i hang around and talk to.
            <br><br>
            I usually berate myself because frankly i hate myself - alot, and now i rely on self-degradation as a crutch for my feelings, i feel like i have no-one to explain my feelings to. I don't make things easier for myself since i don't like talking about my feelings that much, never liked the idea of making a private twitter cause that honestly feels like bitching whenever i feel down, i also tend to avoid turning to IRL friends about these feelings (and no i will never use a #serious channel on any discord, too many prying eyes looking for reasons not to like me).
            <br><br>
            So if i have such an issue talking about my feelings why do i keep trying to talk to people that clearly treat me different for being honest?
            <br><br>
            That's bullshit, i'm just stressing out again.
            <br><br>
            But if that's the case, why do i keep feeling like a second class friend?
            <br><br>
            Clearly people i used to think that they were my closest buddies see me in a different way now, and for many reasons too, from leaving a discord server, to having my opinions, or just for being a freak. I know i can be an asshole sometimes, and i own up to it, but i can't change - at least i gave up hope on it.
            <br><br>
            I just wish that they owned up to it and told me straight up that they don't care or they don't wanna talk to me, not this bullshit where they drag me around treating me as a Second Class Friend that they can just bring up when they're bored or want to make a joke about.
            <br><br>
            I'm sorry if i did anything wrong to you, not asking to be friends again, but i am asking for you to make up your minds, block me or talk to me.

                            I still remember, i just turned 18, had a really shit day at school, teacher didn't give a fuck about her unruly class and they bullied me, she heared everything - they were shouting.
                            <br><br>
                            Nothing against her, she was tired, it's fair.
                            <br><br>
                            I get home to then my then already divorced parents shouting at each other, by then it was nothing unusual to me so i said hi and i went into my room.
                            <br><br>
                            I did nothing, just play games and listen to youtube videos, my brother and sisters messaged me "Happy Birthday!" and i replied with the usual "Thank youuu!!!", they couldn't do much more, they were far far away from me.
                            <br><br>
                            No one near to me gave a shit it was my birthday.
                            <br><br>
                            We started talking in a call for a bit, don't even remember about what or why, and i remember i just broke down. People usually don't care about me, but that day hurt.
                            <br><br>
                            You let me cry myself out and was there for the entire thing.
                            <br><br>I don't know if you thought it was awkward or you were being really nice to me, i don't know how to trust someone in that way.
                            <br><br>
                            Either way, thank you, for letting me have a nice memory.
